🏦 Bank Management System (C++) — Summary
This project is a command-line banking system coded in classic C++ style with old-school charm 😎. It allows users and bank staff to perform everyday banking operations through a text-based UI.

🔧 Core Features
👤 User Account Management
New user registration
View existing user info
Update & delete user records
Search user by ID

💰 Transactions
Deposit and withdraw funds
Transfer money between accounts
Pay utility bills

🏧 ATM System
User login using ID, PIN & password
Balance check
ATM-style withdrawal
Account detail viewing

📁 File Handling
All data is stored in text files like bank.txt, bill.txt — no database involved
Basic CRUD operations are handled via file I/O (read/write/overwrite)

💡 Technical Details
Uses fstream for file operations
getch() is used to mask PIN and password input (adds realism!)
Uses goto and system("cls") (a bit outdated, but gets the job done)
Implemented as a single bank class with 20+ member functions
No external libraries or advanced frameworks

🚨 Limitations
No input validation (e.g. invalid phone numbers or duplicates)
Uses plain text for storing sensitive info (not secure)
Procedural control flow (uses goto — not recommended)
Not modular or object-oriented enough for modern standards

🧠 Verdict:
A strong academic-level project that shows solid understanding of:
Classes and functions in C++
File handling
Basic authentication logic
Could be a great base if you want to:
Convert it into a GUI app (like with Qt or C++/CLI)
Shift it to Java or Python for better extensibility
Or connect it to a database (like SQLite or MySQL)
